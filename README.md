# Week4Assignment
This weeks assignment was to create a vowel counter for any file the user inputs and runs it through the command line. When ran, the program will gather every character in said 
file and will determine if the character is a vowel. If the character is a vowel, it will add 1 to each variable and will print out the total number of vowels at the end of 
the program running. 
I added J, S, and K variables as well to include the 3 extra letters needed for this weeks submission
